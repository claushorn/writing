Artificial intelligence (AI) is revolutionizing scientific discovery, yet its decision-making processes often remain opaque. Mechanistic interpretability, the endeavor to reverse-engineer neural networks into human-understandable components, offers a pathway to transform AI from a black-box predictor into a transparent scientific instrument [1].

## From Black Boxes to Scientific Instruments
Recent studies have demonstrated that AI models, particularly protein language models (pLMs), can learn representations aligning with biological structures. For instance, sparse autoencoders have been utilized to identify interpretable features in pLMs, revealing latent structures that correspond to biological motifs and functions. Such findings suggest that these models encapsulate emergent hypotheses within their parameters, offering novel insights into biological systems [2].

## Integrating Mechanistic Interpretability into Scientific Practice
Mechanistic interpretability should evolve from a retrospective analysis to an integral component of scientific methodology. By employing automated pipelines for circuit analysis and neuron clustering, researchers can dissect AI models to uncover the causal pathways of their predictions [3]. This approach enables the alignment of model internals with human-understandable abstractions, such as gene regulatory networks and disease pathways, facilitating actionable biological insights.

## Neuro-Symbolic Reasoning and Representation Engineering
Integrating interpretability with symbolic reasoning provides a promising pathway to foster collaborative AI systems. Neuro-symbolic frameworks combine neural networks with symbolic reasoning systems, enhancing the interpretability and robustness of AI models [4]. Representation engineering further aids in aligning AI models with scientific concepts, allowing for the manipulation of internal representations to achieve desired properties [5].

## A New Epistemology for AI-Driven Science
Mechanistic interpretability is more than a technical exercise; it provides a modern epistemological framework. It challenges us to understand how AI encodes, abstracts, and recombines knowledge. The universality hypothesis, that different AI models learn similar abstractions,  suggests a bridge between human theories and machine-learned concepts [6]. This alignment could lead to formal frameworks that map AI internals onto scientific laws, enabling verification, refinement, and even discovery of new phenomena.

## Toward a Science of AI Explanations
The advancement of AI in science is based on systematic, automated interpretability that is reliable, scalable and utilizes causal reasoning. We need benchmarks that measure interpretability’s utility in real-world scientific tasks, from protein function prediction to disease classification. Collaborative efforts between AI researchers and domain scientists are essential to ensure that interpretability yields relevant and actionable insights [7].

## Conclusion
Mechanistic interpretability promisses to be pivotal in transforming AI into a transparent collaborator in scientific discovery. By decoding the circuits and representations that underpin AI reasoning, we can unlock new scientific hypotheses, align AI models with domain knowledge, and build a new foundation for AI-driven discovery. The path forward lies in automation, interdisciplinary collaboration, and a commitment to turn AI’s hidden structures into bridges to new science.
